# Introduction

Five Nights At Freddy's 1 is a simple but complex game. It involves four animatronics with varying levels of difficulty and different mechanics. 

My intended audience for this game is the new player who wants to learn how to play FNAF 1 in an effective and fun manner. In this tutorial, I will introduce all animatronics and walk you through the nights, including Night 6, 4/20 mode, and even your first green run (WIP).

And don’t worry about understanding everything. I will fill in the details as the nights go on.

**Quick note on AI level:** AI level determines how fast the animatronics move. This is all you need to know for now, but do note that this gets more complicated as the game progresses.

# Background:
In the game you play as the night security guard at a pizzeria, and there are animatronics who move during the night, getting more aggressive as the week progresses. The description for the game explains this best:

*Welcome to your new summer job at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, where kids and parents alike come for entertainment and food as far as the eye can see! The main attraction is Freddy Fazbear, of course; and his two friends. They are animatronic robots, programmed to please the crowds! The robots' behavior has become somewhat unpredictable at night however, and it was much cheaper to hire you as a security guard than to find a repairman.*

*From your small office you must watch the security cameras carefully. You have a very limited amount of electricity that you're allowed to use per night (corporate budget cuts, you know). That means when you run out of power for the night- no more security doors and no more lights! If something isn't right- namely if Freddy Bear or his friends aren't in their proper places, you must find them on the monitors and protect yourself if needed!*

*Can you survive five nights at Freddy's?*

You certainly can! Let’s find out how:

## AI Levels
Refer back to this if needed. **You don’t have to worry about it right now.** AI level is directly correlated to how fast and aggressive the animatronics are.

They scale from 1 to 20.


|**Night**|**Freddy**|**Bonnie**|**Chica**|**Foxy**|
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
|1|0|0|0|0|
|2|0|3|1|1|
|3|1|0|5|2|
|4|1-2\*|2|4|6|
|5|3|5|7|5|
\* 50/50 Chance decided from the start of the night.

AI Levels increase for the animatronics as the night progresses:



2 AM: Bonnie lvl +1

3 AM: Bonnie, Chica, Foxy lvl +1

4 AM: Bonnie, Chica, Foxy lvl +1
# Night 1: Practice night.
**AI LEVEL BY 5AM: 0-3-2-2** 

**(Freddy-Bonnie-Chica-Foxy)** 

Welcome to FNAF! Take this time to get used to the mechanics of the game. Here are a few things to note:

- There are **four** animatronics. Freddy, Chica, Bonnie, and Foxy. I will elaborate more on these later
- **You cannot move out of your office**. You are stuck there for the duration of the game. You can, however, stall animatronics using the mechanics I will talk about shortly.
- If you run out of power, you ***WILL*** die in 10-60 seconds to Freddy, that time being completely random. The **only** way to survive is by getting to 6AM before he kills you.

There are three mechanics you can use to your advantage:

- Cameras: You can use cameras to check where animatronics are. There are multiple cameras to choose from, a few of which being of great use.

- Lights: You can use lights to check for certain animatronics.

- Doors: You can close doors to prevent animatronics from getting into your office.

However, you also have to worry about **power**. The more lights, cameras, and doors you use, the more power you will consume. You will learn how to manage your power shortly, but remember, this night is easy!

The goal is to last until 6AM, starting from 12AM. Every 1 minute and 30 seconds, an hour will pass. This means that each night lasts 9 minutes.

**None of the animatronics will move until 2AM on this night only**. You can use this opportunity to listen to the phone call to learn more about the game. After 2AM, you will have to worry about three animatronics:

- **Foxy** - Foxy lives at camera 1C, which differs from the other animatronics who reside at camera 1A. Foxy moves if you don’t check the cameras for a while, so **as long as you check the cameras you should be fine**. We will elaborate on Foxy later. 
  - He attacks via your **left door.**
- **Bonnie -** Bonnie can teleport to a few select locations. He doesn’t move in a set path, so you don’t really have to worry about checking the cameras for him. Instead, *you should check your **left** hall light.*
  - He attacks via your **left door.**
- **Chica -** Chica follows a set path which goes “Show stage > Dining hall > Hallway > Kitchen > Right hallway > R. Hallway Corner > Left door”. She can go back and forth between these locations, but only one at a time.
  - She attacks via your **right door.**
  - Chica is in the kitchen when you hear pots and pans clattering on that camera, which has audio only.

The best strategy on this night is to close your left door when you’re at 90% power, leaving it on until you have 8% left, which will work up to night three. *However, this doesn’t do you any good as you aren’t learning anything!* Instead, I’d suggest **playing around with the game for some time**. You’re pretty much guaranteed to win with the knowledge that I just gave you.

Have fun!

# Night 2: Picking things up
**AI LEVEL BY 5AM: 0-6-3-3**

**(Freddy-Bonnie-Chica-Foxy)** 

Night 2 is a harder version of night 1. Bonnie attacks more often on this night, as well as Chica and Foxy (though you still don’t have to worry about him that much)

A few things are of note on this night:

- **The animatronics can begin movement immediately.** They will not start moving at 2AM this time.
- You’ll definitely need to check your lights more on this night, as Bonnie and Chica move more often. This also means they also disappear faster too, so you’ll waste less power.
- Check the cameras for Foxy every once and a while (Cam 1C). **It’s still rare for him to attack on this night, but possible.** If you don’t see him (curtain is open and you can’t see Foxy), follow these steps:
  - **Don’t switch your camera.**
  - Close your **left** door.
  - Switch to camera **2A.**
  - Wait for the banging sound. Once you hear it, you can open your door.
    - When this happens, *Foxy will take some power*. 1% the first time he attacks that night, 6% the second time, and incrementing 5% for each additional attack
- Freddy will still not move, he will begin to move on night 3.
- If Bonnie is at your door and it is closed, you can use **his shadow** as an indicator that he is still there. Pay close attention to the left corner of your office when the light is on. **That’s where his shadow will be when he is there.**
- If the door won’t close and an error sounds, **you cannot do anything** about it except for waiting until 6AM. Foxy will eventually attack you if you wait long enough, but if you open the cameras Bonnie/Chica will attack.
  - This is rare on the first few nights.

This night should be a breeze for you. You got this!

# Night 3: Freddy makes his appearance
**AI LEVEL BY 5AM: 1-3-7-4**

**(Freddy-Bonnie-Chica-Foxy)** 

Night 3 picks up the pace. You now can’t use the “close the left door strategy”, as it will drain too much power (this is why I said to not use it). All animatronics will move faster, so be vigilant.

The biggest addition to this night is Freddy. Freddy moves in a set path, in the same way Chica does. Freddy, however, has special considerations and is especially difficult to deal with. *Luckily, Freddy doesn’t move very much this night*

Some notes about Freddy:

- Freddy is **very** difficult to see on camera. You can make him out as two white eyes in especially dark areas of the map.
  - When he is in the kitchen, he plays his signature music (March of the Toreador).
- **Freddy laughs every time he moves.** When he laughs 6 times, he might be at your **right corner**, which you should check **immediately.**
  - If Freddy is in the left corner camera (4B), **close your right door immediately.**
  - Wait for him to laugh, then open the door again. Repeat as necessary. 
- Freddy is special as he **cannot be seen by your hallway lights**. He can enter directly from the hallway corner, skipping the “outside your door” part that Chica and Bonnie have.

Notes about the night:

- Chica is **much** more active on this night. Checking lights is heavily encouraged.
- Foxy and Bonnie still become more active, so be sure to check Cam 1C often
- Checking Freddy often can prevent him from moving.
- Don’t follow the phone call advice for this night. Playing dead will **not** stop Freddy from killing you if the power runs out.

The recommended strategy from this night onward is CFL, or “Cove, Freddy, Lights”. This strategy is fast paced, but you can go slowly on these first few nights using it. It works as follows:

- Check whatever camera Freddy is at (count his laughs and select the corresponding camera.)
  - 0 laughs > “Show stage”. 1 laugh > “Dining hall”. And so on.
- Check Cam 1C.
- Check both hallway lights, closing doors if necessary.
- Repeat the process.

This strategy is **very fast paced**, but you can use nights 3 and 4 as practice for the more difficult nights.

Best of luck to you! 

# Night 4: Night 5 pregame
**AI LEVEL BY 5AM: 1/2-5-6-8** 

**(Freddy-Bonnie-Chica-Foxy)** 

Night 4 is pretty much a dilute version of night 5. Freddy isn’t a huge threat if you’re smart, but Bonnie and Foxy become **much more active**.

Now that you actually have to worry about Foxy, you should be checking his camera much more often, but in the CFL strategy you shouldn’t have to worry about this.

Some tips for this night:

- Now is a good time to **begin speeding up your movements.** The faster you go, the more guaranteed you will survive.
- The “just close the left door” strategy will **no longer work from this night onward.**
- If Freddy moves from the show stage, just *check his new location*.
  - You can use his laugh as a gauge as to where he is.

Now that you’re more experienced, we can provide some more details on the animatronics:

- When Foxy is gone, he will take around 45 seconds to get to your room, unless you switch to camera 2A. If you switch to camera 2A, **you will only have two or so seconds before he attacks.**
  - You can use this to your advantage by switching to camera 2A after you close your *left* door. This will speed up Foxy’s attack, conserving power.
- **You cannot view more than one animatronic on a camera at once, even if there are multiple animatronics actually there.** This is important in the later nights as it can give the false impression that the animatronics are missing when they are actually not.
- **Hallucinations** have a 1/1000 chance of happening every tick (32 milliseconds). **Don’t let them mess you up!**

This night is the last night before night 5. Enjoy the peace before the storm. Good luck ;)
# Night 5: The Finale
**AI LEVEL BY 5AM: 3-8-9-7**

**(Freddy-Bonnie-Chica-Foxy)** 

Night 5 is by far the most difficult night. Freddy moves quite a lot this night, Foxy is a major threat, and Bonnie and Chica will continue to pester you. We will elaborate much more on Freddy tonight.

Here are some notes about Freddy:

- When Freddy decides to move, he will first check if you are **looking at him**. If you are looking at him, **he will not move**. This happens often so make sure you check his camera **very often**.
- **Freddy doesn’t backtrack after he makes his way to the right hallway**. He will continue back and forth between the right hallway and the right hallway corner for the rest of the night.
- Chica takes priority over Freddy on cameras, this means that Chica being in the hallway corner **doesn’t mean Freddy isn’t there.**
- If Freddy makes his way to the hallway corner, he can attack when:
  - You have the right hallway door open **AND**
  - You are not looking at Camera 4B **AND**
  - You have your cameras open
- Some ways you can stop Freddy attacks when he is at the corner include:
  - **Closing the right door** before opening your cameras, then **opening it** after closing your cameras.
  - Opening the camera **onto camera 4B**
    - We will explain the significance of this move on Night 7.
- If Freddy is at the hallway corner and he laughs, he has probably moved away to the hallway. If he hasn’t, he’ll… let you know…

A few notes about the night:

- Check Foxy and Freddy often using the CFL strategy. They move a lot more on this night.
- **IMPORTANT:** If Foxy tries to move while you are looking at him, all of his attempts to move will fail for a random amount of time (between less than a second and 16 seconds)
  - This means Foxy should be a problem if you look at his camera often.
- **If you run out of power, not all hope is lost!** Freddy has between 10-60 seconds to kill you, and you still have a chance of surviving if you are around halfway through 5AM.


Best of luck to you! If you beat this you have completed the base game 🙂

This might take a few tries, so don’t give up!

# Congratulations!
You have beaten Five Nights at Freddys 1. I knew you could do it! You should now see a star on the home screen to signify your achievement, with the other two coming from night 6 and the infamous 4/20 mode.

In Volume 2 I will explain Night 6, as well as special modes such as 4/20 and Green Running. This takes a great deal of research of timings to do, so please be patient! If you have any questions about this game, please don’t be afraid to contact me and I will answer to the best of my ability. You can also do research of your own, as well as ask other players, forums, and even youtubers.

**So what’s next?**

After FNAF 1, there are 5 more FNAF games in the base set, as well as the newer games such as Security Breach. FNAF 2 is a much more complex version of the base game, having 10 animatronics to worry about, as well as added mechanics and gamemodes. I might make a guide in the future on this game, but I haven’t beaten it yet so it’s not guaranteed yet.

Thank you for reading this short guide! I hope you enjoy your future FNAF endeavors, and have a beautiful day!
